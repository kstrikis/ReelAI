   - Added proper .gitignore file to prevent future commits of user-specific files

2. Firebase Integration:
   - Added Firebase SDK dependencies through Swift Package Manager
   - Configured FirebaseApp initialization in ReelAIApp.swift
   - Added NavigationView wrapper for better navigation support

Known Issues:

Next Steps:

2. Address SwiftLint warnings
