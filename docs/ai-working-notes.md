~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an end-to-end plan for our MVP's data architecture in Firebase, along with naming conventions and inline comments for future enhancements.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Firebase Authentication & Demo Mode
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• We'll use Firebase Auth for standard user authentication.  
• For demo purposes, add a "Demo Login" button on the login screen.  
  – When tapping Demo Login, use a fixed demo account (for example, hard-code credentials or use Firebase's anonymous authentication and then link to a "demo" profile).  
  – This lets developers and demonstrators bypass a full sign-up flow quickly.  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Firestore Data Model
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Our schema revolves around a few key collections. We'll follow lowerCamelCase for fields and plural names for collections.

A. Users Collection ("users")
  – Each user document is keyed by the UID from Firebase Auth.
  – Fields (in lowerCamelCase):
   • displayName (String) – User's chosen display name.
   • username (String) – Unique username for the user.
   • email (String, optional) – Email from Auth (if available).
   • profileImageUrl (String, optional) – Link to user avatar stored in Firebase Storage.
   • createdAt (Timestamp) – When the user joined.

B. Videos Collection ("videos")
  – Each video document represents a user-uploaded video.
  – Core Fields:
   • ownerId (String) – The UID of the user who created the video
   • username (String) – Creator's username (denormalized for efficiency)
   • title (String) – Video title
   • description (String, optional) – Full description
   • computedMediaUrl (String) – Computed URL to the video file in Storage, derived from video ID and owner ID
   • createdAt (Timestamp) – Creation time
   • updatedAt (Timestamp) – Last modification time
  – Engagement Sub-object:
   • viewCount (Int) – Number of views
   • likeCount (Int) – Number of likes
   • dislikeCount (Int) – Number of dislikes
   • tags (Map<String, Int>) – Tag name to usage count mapping

  // Example document structure:
  {
    "ownerId": "user123",
    "username": "creator",
    "title": "My Cool Video",
    "description": "Check this out!",
    "computedMediaUrl": "// mediaUrl is now computed from video ID and owner ID",
    "createdAt": <Timestamp>,
    "updatedAt": <Timestamp>,
    "engagement": {
      "viewCount": 1000,
      "likeCount": 50,
      "dislikeCount": 2,
      "tags": {
        "funny": 30,
        "creative": 25
      }
    }
  }

C. Comments Structure
Comments are stored as subcollections under each video document:
videos/{videoId}/comments/{commentId}

  – Comment Fields:
   • userId (String) – Commenter's UID
   • username (String) – Commenter's username
   • text (String) – Comment content
   • createdAt (Timestamp) – When posted
   • likeCount (Int) – Number of likes
   • dislikeCount (Int) – Number of dislikes
   • replyTo (String, optional) – Parent comment ID if this is a reply

  // Example comment document:
  {
    "userId": "user456",
    "username": "commenter",
    "text": "Great video!",
    "createdAt": <Timestamp>,
    "likeCount": 5,
    "dislikeCount": 0,
    "replyTo": null
  }

D. Reactions Tracking
Reactions are stored in subcollections to track individual user reactions:
videos/{videoId}/comments/{commentId}/reactions/{reactionId}

  – Reaction Fields:
   • userId (String) – User who reacted
   • createdAt (Timestamp) – When the reaction was made
   • isLike (Boolean) – true for like, false for dislike

  // Example reaction document:
  {
    "userId": "user789",
    "createdAt": <Timestamp>,
    "isLike": true
  }

──────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Key Operations
──────────────────────────────────────────────

A. Video Operations:
  • Create video with initial metadata
  • Fetch videos (with optional user filter)
  • Update video metadata
  • Delete video (and all associated subcollections)

B. Engagement Operations:
  • Increment view count
  • Add/remove likes or dislikes
  • Add tags with user counts
  • Track user-specific reactions

C. Comment Operations:
  • Add comment (top-level or reply)
  • Fetch comments for a video
  • Add/remove comment reactions
  • Track user-specific reactions to comments

D. Query Patterns:
  • Get recent videos
  • Get user's videos
  • Get video comments
  • Check user's reactions
  • Get trending videos (by engagement)

──────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Security Rules
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Key security considerations:
• Users can only edit their own profiles
• Anyone can view videos and comments
• Only authenticated users can create content
• Users can only edit/delete their own content
• Reaction counts must be incremented/decremented atomically
• One reaction per user per content item

──────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Firebase Storage Structure
──────────────────────────────────────────────
We'll use Firebase Storage to hold the actual media files referenced in our Firestore documents.

• Organization in Storage should be clear and maintainable:
  – /users/{uid}/profileImage.jpg
  – /videos/{userId}/{videoId}.mp4
  – Future additions, such as AI-generated content, should follow the user-based structure:
    • /videos/{userId}/ai/{videoId}/audio.mp3
    • /videos/{userId}/ai/{videoId}/images/...

• Key points about video storage:
  – Videos are organized by user ID first, then video ID
  – This structure allows for easy user-based queries and cleanup
  – Each video has a unique ID that's shared between Firestore and Storage
  – The computed URL in the Video model matches this structure

──────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Naming Conventions in Swift & Firestore
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Collections: Use plural names, e.g., "users", "videos", "comments", "likes".  
• Document Fields: Use lowerCamelCase (e.g., ownerId, createdAt, profileImageUrl).  
• Swift Models: Mirror Firestore fields with Swift structs/classes that conform to Codable. For example:

  struct User: Codable {
   let displayName: String
   let email: String?
   let profileImageUrl: String?
   let createdAt: Date
  }

  struct Video: Codable {
   let ownerId: String
   let title: String
   let description: String?
   let mediaUrls: [String: String]  // e.g., a dictionary mapping clip types to URLs
   let createdAt: Date
   let status: String
  }

• By following a consistent naming scheme, both the Firestore documents and the Swift code remain in sync, simplifying queries and data parsing.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Comments on Future Planning
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• For now, our plan focuses on core functionality: user authentication (including a demo mode), video capture/upload, basic editing metadata storage, and simple interaction tracking.  
• As we evolve the app, we can introduce additional fields like AI-generated script data, voice synthesis metadata, and more refined editing history.  
• We're mindful of avoiding over-embedding data; by favoring references (like storing user UID in video documents) and subcollections for interactions, we maintain scalability.
  – If we see extremely heavy interaction volumes, we might consider alternative patterns (like storing aggregate counts or using Cloud Functions for real-time tallies).

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary
──────────────────────────────────────────────
By using Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Firebase Storage together, we'll create a fast, scalable MVP that lets users log in (with a demo option), create videos from various media components, and interact with content in real time. Our data model uses clean naming conventions and a modular structure that is easy to extend as more advanced AI features are added.

This approach meets our immediate need to demonstrate a meme video creation tool while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Video Publishing Flow
──────────────────────────────────────────────
The video publishing process follows these steps:

1. Video Selection & Processing:
   – User selects video through PhotosPicker
   – System creates a temporary file in app's sandbox
   – Video is loaded through Photos framework for preview
   – A unique videoId is generated for both Storage and Firestore

2. Upload Process:
   – VideoUploadService verifies file stability with retries
   – Uploads to Firebase Storage at /videos/{userId}/{videoId}.mp4
   – Progress updates are provided through Combine publishers
   – Metadata includes content type and file size

3. State Management:
   – PublishingView tracks upload state and progress
   – Provides user feedback through progress updates
   – Handles errors and success states
   – Cleans up temporary files after upload

4. Key Implementation Notes:
   – Uses Swift's PhotosPicker for video selection
   – Implements retry logic for file size verification
   – Provides progress updates through Combine
   – Handles cleanup of temporary files
   – Maintains consistent videoId between Storage and Firestore

──────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Firebase Data Audit Tool
──────────────────────────────────────────────
A debug tool has been implemented to maintain data integrity across Firebase services.

• Audit Checks:
  – Firestore video documents without Storage files
  – Invalid video documents (decode failures, missing users)
  – Storage files without Firestore documents
  – Files not following .mp4 format
  – Orphaned reactions
  – Path structure violations

• Tool Features:
  – One-click audit initiation
  – Progress tracking during audit
  – Detailed issue descriptions
  – Safe deletion of problematic items
  – Comprehensive logging
  – Results clearing

• Implementation Notes:
  – Located in DebugMenuView for development builds only
  – Uses async/await for efficient Firebase operations
  – Maintains atomic operations for deletions
  – Provides clear error messages and paths
  – Follows established logging standards

• Usage Guidelines:
  – Run periodically to catch data inconsistencies
  – Review issues before deletion
  – Check logs for operation details
  – Clear results after review
  – Use during development and testing phases

──────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Video Feed Implementation Notes (2024-02-06)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Current Concerns:

1. Resource Loading:
   - Duplicate resource fetching detected in logs (GTMSessionFetcher "already running" warnings)
   - Root cause: preloadVideosAround() being called redundantly in loadMoreVideos()
   - Need to remove redundant preload calls and ensure single resource fetch per video

2. Video Transform Issues:
   - AVAssetTrack warnings about unrecognized "currentVideoTrack.preferredTransform" keys
   - Current approach of loading .preferredTransform directly on track is incorrect
   - Need to investigate proper AVAssetTrack property loading sequence

Progress:
- Successfully implemented single player initialization per video
- Achieved stable video looping
- Eliminated multiple buffering states
- Implemented clean preloading sequence
- Reduced memory footprint by limiting preloaded videos

Next Steps:
1. Remove redundant preloadVideosAround() calls
2. Research and implement correct AVAssetTrack transform loading
3. Verify resource cleanup on video transitions

- Camera restricted to portrait mode only
- Videos stored in Documents/Videos directory for persistence

## Debugging Notes
- Camera orientation needs to be set to 90 degrees for proper portrait display
- Camera initialization should happen when view becomes active
- Camera cleanup on view disappear is important for resource management
- Videos are now saved locally before upload to ensure persistence
- Thumbnails are generated on-demand for better performance
- Gallery view is presented modally to maintain camera state

## Decisions
- Using singleton pattern for CameraManager to prevent multiple instances
- Keeping camera in portrait mode only
- Front camera as default for better user experience
- Tab-based navigation with proper view lifecycle management
- Storing videos in Documents directory for persistence and backup
- Using AVAssetImageGenerator for thumbnail generation
- Gallery accessed via camera view to maintain better UX flow

## Logging Standards
- Each component uses a consistent first emoji as its "sheet" identifier:
  - 📼 for LocalVideoService operations
  - 🖼️ for Gallery/UI operations
  - 📸 for Camera operations
  - 📤 for Upload operations
  - 🔄 for async/await conversions

- Second emoji indicates specific operation type:
  - 🎬 for initialization/setup
  - 📁 for directory/file operations
  - 💾 for saving operations
  - 🔍 for search/fetch operations
  - 🗑️ for deletion operations
  - 🖼️ for thumbnail operations
  - ⚙️ for configuration
  - 📊 for progress/status
  - ✅ for success
  - 🔑 for authentication
  - 📤 for upload operations
  - 🛑 for stopping/cleanup

- Error logging uses distinct patterns:
  - ❌ 💥 for serious errors
  - ❌ 🔒 for authentication errors
  - ❌ 🚫 for validation/state errors
  - ⚠️ for warnings

Example:
```swift
print("📼 🎬 Initializing LocalVideoService")  // Component + Operation
print("❌ 💥 Failed to save video: \(error)")   // Error pattern
```

## Video Feed Process Timeline Summary (Pre-Correction)

Below is a machine-readable JSON summary that details the precise lifecycle, timing, and key data objects/logic of the VideoFeedView process for loading video data and preloading players as the user scrolls. **This summary represents the state of the VideoFeedView process before any corrections were applied to fix its faults.**

## Renovation Process for Video Feed Process Improvements

Below are the step-by-step instructions that our team must follow to renovate the Video Feed process. Each step represents the smallest testable unit:

1. **Evaluate Firestore Data Retrieval under Intermittent Network Conditions**
   - Write unit tests to simulate network timeouts in `loadInitialVideos`.
   - Validate that errors are correctly logged and that the UI reflects an appropriate error state when no videos are returned.

2. **Improve Asset Preloading in `preloadVideo`**
   - Create tests that simulate failures in loading essential asset properties (e.g., `isPlayable`, duration).
   - Implement a retry mechanism or fallback for transient failures during asset loading.

3. **Introduce Cancellation Tokens for Preloading Tasks**
   - Refactor `preloadVideo` to incorporate cancellation tokens so that outdated tasks are cancelled if the user scrolls rapidly.
   - Write unit tests to confirm that cancelled tasks do not update the `preloadedPlayers` dictionary.

4. **Refactor `cleanupInactivePlayers` Method**
   - Develop tests that simulate rapid scrolling to ensure that players outside the active range are properly cleaned up.
   - Verify that memory usage remains stable by ensuring removal of all inactive AVPlayer instances.

5. **Redesign Dummy Page Handling in TabView**
   - Isolate the logic for the dummy page (used for looping) to ensure that resetting `currentIndex` does not trigger redundant preloading or cleanup.
   - Create test cases to simulate circular scrolling and validate a seamless transition back to the start of the feed.

6. **Enhance Error Recovery and User Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Implement granular error recovery in both Firestore queries and video preloading tasks, ensuring that errors are not silently swallowed.
   - Log detailed error messages and update the UI to display specific, actionable feedback to the user.
   - Develop tests to simulate these error conditions and confirm correct error handling.

7. **Incorporate Robust Logging and Backpressure Control**
   - Add explicit logging for all asynchronous tasks, particularly during the preloading phase, to track their lifecycle and cancellation.
   - Introduce throttling mechanisms to prevent a backlog of preloading tasks during rapid user interactions.
   - Validate these controls with integration tests that simulate high load and verify correct behavior.

8. **Conduct Integration Testing in a Staging Environment**
   - Simulate high-load scenarios with rapid scrolling and intermittent network conditions to observe system behavior.
   - Monitor memory usage, resource cleanup, and responsiveness of AVPlayer instances under stress.
   - Collect logs to analyze the backpressure mechanism and overall system stability.

9. **Final Review and Staging Verification**
   - Perform a final pass in the staging environment to verify that user experience is smooth and that error occurrences are minimized.
   - Update working notes with any additional observations and prepare a concise commit message reflecting the critical changes.
