────────────────────────────
1. Overview & Objectives
────────────────────────────
• Testing is integral to our development process. We expect comprehensive coverage across unit, integration, UI, and performance tests.  
• Our tests should be automated, deterministic, and isolated. They must catch regressions early and provide confidence for changes going into production.  
• All tests must pass in the CI pipeline; no code will be merged if any tests are failing.

────────────────────────────
2. Unit Testing with XCTest
────────────────────────────
• Use XCTest as our primary testing framework. All new features, bug fixes, or refactors must be accompanied by relevant unit tests.
• Write test cases in files that follow our naming convention (e.g., MyModuleTests.swift). Each test class should inherit from XCTestCase.
• Use setUp() and tearDown() methods to prepare and clean up test state. Ensure tests are independent and do not rely on reused or shared state.
• Apply the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern to keep tests clear and maintainable.
• For asynchronous code, use XCTestExpectation to wait for completion instead of arbitrary sleep calls.

Example:
--------------------------------------------------
import XCTest
@testable import MyApp

class FeatureTests: XCTestCase {
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        // Set up necessary state for tests
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        // Clean up after tests
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    func testExample() {
        // Arrange
        let expectedValue = 42
        
        // Act
        let result = Feature().computeValue()
        
        // Assert
        XCTAssertEqual(result, expectedValue, "Computed value should be equal to \(expectedValue)")
    }
    
    func testAsyncOperation() {
        let expectation = self.expectation(description: "Async task completes")
        
        Feature().performAsyncOperation { result in
            // Assert within the callback
            XCTAssertTrue(result.isSuccess, "Async operation should succeed")
            expectation.fulfill()
        }
        
        wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 5)
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

3. Integration Testing
────────────────────────────
• Integration tests verify that multiple components work correctly together.
• Ensure critical flows that span across modules are covered. For example:
  – Network ↔ Data parsing
  – Persistence ↔ Business logic
• Where external dependencies (e.g., web services or databases) exist, prefer using test doubles (mocks, stubs, or fakes) to isolate behavior.
• If needed, maintain a separate target for integration tests to segregate them from the standard unit tests.

────────────────────────────
4. UI Testing with XCUITest
────────────────────────────
• Use XCUITest for end-to-end testing of key UI flows. Keep these tests minimal, focusing on critical user journeys (e.g., onboarding, login/logout, and major workflows).
• Place UI tests in the dedicated UITests target. Name the test files and methods with the “UITest” suffix for clarity.
• Use accessibility identifiers to reliably locate UI elements.
• Keep UI tests as deterministic as possible; avoid relying on unpredictable environmental factors.

────────────────────────────
5. Performance Testing
────────────────────────────
• For performance-critical areas, include tests using XCTest’s measure block.
• Run performance tests over multiple iterations to capture realistic metrics. Use XCTAssert functions to verify if performance benchmarks remain within acceptable limits.
• Document any performance expectations within the test cases.

Example:
--------------------------------------------------
func testPerformanceExample() {
    self.measure {
         let _ = Feature().performHeavyOperation()
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

────────────────────────────
6. Running Tests Locally & via CI
────────────────────────────
• Run tests frequently on your local machine using Xcode’s “Test” action or via the command line:
  xcodebuild -scheme "MyApp" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 12,OS=latest' clean test
• Our CI pipeline is configured to build, run tests, and generate code coverage reports automatically. Ensure your branch passes all tests locally before pushing commits.
• Maintain a high code coverage percentage (target is 80% or above); exceptions should be clearly documented, and non-critical code may be excluded if justified.

────────────────────────────
7. Best Practices for Writing Tests
────────────────────────────
• Write tests that are:
  – Isolated: Each test should run independently and be repeatable without side effects.
  – Deterministic: Avoid using randomness or the system clock. Instead, use dependency injection to control such factors.
  – Readable: Use descriptive names and clear Arrange-Act-Assert comments. Clear tests help diagnose failures.
• Use meaningful assertion messages to simplify debugging when tests fail.
• If a test requires disabling certain behaviors or mocking external states, document the setup inline so that future maintainers understand the rationale.
• Refactor tests as necessary to avoid duplication and to increase clarity.

────────────────────────────
8. Organizing and Maintaining Test Code
────────────────────────────
• Align the organization of your test cases with that of the application’s code structure. This helps in quickly locating tests related to a specific module.
• Regularly review and update tests as the code evolves. Remove tests for deprecated functionality.
• Use helper methods or test utilities to reduce boilerplate code, but ensure they remain local to the test target to prevent coupling with production code.

────────────────────────────
9. Debugging and Investigating Failures
────────────────────────────
• When a test fails, reproduce the failure locally before pushing changes.
• Use Xcode’s debugging tools (breakpoints, logging) to inspect test failures.
• Document any known issues or flakiness in tests, and work with the team to improve overall stability.
• If third-party dependencies or asynchronous flows are involved, ensure proper handling of race conditions or delayed responses in tests.

────────────────────────────
Summary
────────────────────────────
• Maintain robust automated tests that cover unit, integration, UI, and performance validations.
• Always run tests locally—and ensure they pass—before committing any changes.
• Adhere to our testing best practices: isolated, deterministic, and well-documented test cases are non-negotiable.
• Leverage our CI pipeline for automated builds, tests, and code coverage reporting.
